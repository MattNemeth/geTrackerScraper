# geTrackerScraper
Pulls data from GE Tracker to pool info about certain items to buy and sell items in game.
Currently this script is not very efficient. However, it's much faster than manually jumping to each site or searching GE tracker. In the future I hope to have many more items that I personally like to flip so that I can easily view which of my favorite items are rising or dropping.

Packages you need for this script include:
1. xlsxwriter
2. selenium
3. beautifulsoup4
